### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on multiple projects where I primarily use Python and Vue.js, and occasionally React. As a Senior Solution Engineer at HashTrust Technology, I take care of client requirements and ensure a clean and organized Jira board ðŸ˜¸.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a variety of topics, including some DevOps concepts. While I have a basic understanding of Docker, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the software industry. Currently, I'm diving into Tailwind CSS, React, and MongoDB. I even built my portfolio website using React! Feel free to check it out: VIVEK.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with like-minded individuals who can challenge and inspire me. I believe collaboration is a great way to learn and enhance my skills.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mastering advanced data structures and algorithms, as well as improving my understanding of system design principles. I'm always open to learning from others and seeking help when needed.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about full-stack web development! I have expertise in both front-end technologies such as Vue.js and back-end frameworks like Django. I'm also familiar with database technologies such as MongoDB and MySQL. Additionally, I have a strong knowledge of Git, squash, and Travis for version control and continuous integration.

ðŸ“« You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile or by emailing me directly at viveksharma4318@gmail.com or vivekpythondev@gmail.com. I'm also available on Discord with the username Viivek#0061, so feel free to ping me there anytime!

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll often find me watching videos and reading articles related to AI and data science. I'm quite active on Twitter as well, where I share my thoughts and insights on Python and Django.
